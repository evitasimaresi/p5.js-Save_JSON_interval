# Receiving data from arduino and Save them in a JSON file
 
I receive data from the Arduino serial port on the serial_comm.js
I process the data separating the string and then export them in a JSOn file.


 _I use the programm p5.serialcontrol_

 ___

 The files:
 *  split.js
 * split2.js

 are not needed anymore, and they will be removed soon.
