# Receiving data from arduino and Save them in a JSON file
 
I receive data from the Arduino serial port on the serial_comm.js
I process the data separating the string and then export them in a JSOn file.

**Update:** The sketch.js file create the vizualised graphics, for real-time representation of the data


 _I use the programm p5.serialcontrol_
